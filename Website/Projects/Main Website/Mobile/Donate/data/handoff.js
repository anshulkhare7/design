And since then Acharya Ji has been regularly speaking in discourses so much so that more than 60 books have been printed, and about 300 more books are ready to be printed.\n\nSpeaking in discourses from 2006 yet YouTube channels started after 5 years and 8 years, i.e. in 2011 and 2014, why? Because Acharya Ji did not focus on publicity.\n\nEven after the channel was made, the discourses were recorded using a simple mobile or a handycam - sometimes in an ordinary room of BodhSthal, and sometimes on a deserted mountain. Acharya Ji would simply sit in his usual clothes and continue to speak in his meditativeness without caring for the camera.\n\nResult?\n\nAs of 2018, there were 4000 videos on the channel, and only 3000 subscribers!\n\nThen from 2019 onwards some of Acharya Ji's well wishers and listeners started actively working for the Foundation. A good amount of money was invested in improving the audio-video recording quality, on creating the right studio-like environment, and on professional editing and audio-video technicians. And then it was clear to everyone that in this day and age, Acharya Ji's teachings can't reach out to the masses without heavy investment in publicity and promotion.\n\nSomehow the Foundation continued promotional activities by raising funds. A large sum of funds is needed to increase the 'reach' of the videos. In today's time, pure and truthful teachings can't be spread without heavy publicity. To ensure that our voice reaches you the Foundation bears a lot of expense. As a result of the same, today more than 1.5 million subscribers have been able to connect to the channel.\n\nThe Foundation uploads around 10 to 15 videos in total on both the channels daily. These videos are freely available to everyone. Till now, just Hindi channel itself has received more than 220 million views and 2021 has been a unique year in this regard. So far, in 2021 only, Hindi channel videos have received more than 100 million views, and in this year alone we have published more than 1000 videos.\n\nBut if we want to propagate Acharya Ji's message with the same intensity with which the Foundation has been working to publish Acharya Ji's videos then it will require A LOT of funds for publicity.\n\nTill today, Acharya Ji's voice reached you because someone else had financially contributed to the Foundation. Otherwise, till 2018 there were only 3000 subscribers! And we are delighted to see you getting benefit out of all the videos the Foundation has been able to upload.\n\nHave you benefited from Acharya Ji's teachings? Do you want Acharya Ji's voice to reach millions and billions of individuals? Do you wish to see that the goal to which Acharya Ji has dedicated his life is realized?\n\nDon't forget that if Acharya Ji's teachings are not reaching you and others, then internal tendencies and external forces which are trying to put your mind, life, nation, and religion into deep darkness are already at play. Flame of this burning candle can save you from darkness but except YOU nobody else can protect this flame.\n\nIf you love Light more than darkness, then contribute as high as possible to the Foundation. The Foundation does not expect even a single rupee for its personal benefits but we require resources to achieve the truthful and courageous goal we have set for ourselves.\n\nWe are fighting this battle for you, it is you who benefits from our hard work, only through your contribution will this mission move forward.","pr":"font-family: Inter;\nfont-size: 18px;\ncolor: #334155;\nvertical-align: top;\nfont-weight: 400;\nletter-spacing: -0.4341176px;\n"},{"ii":96,"tp":"ShapePath","x":0,"y":5842,"w":412,"h":210,"n":"Rectangle","pr":"background-color: #0F172A;\n"}],"n":"Donate_English"}]
