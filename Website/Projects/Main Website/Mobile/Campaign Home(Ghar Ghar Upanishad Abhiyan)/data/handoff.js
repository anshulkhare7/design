are telling you with clarity, truthfulness, and courage that the one who knows and believes in Vedanta is Sanatani.\n\nThis is a bold declaration of ours against all the false propaganda that says:\n\n~ By following the shallow beliefs that change in every village, every city, you become Sanatani.\n~ By celebrating Holi-Diwali, you become Sanatani.\n~ By following any small scripture from here and there without an interpretation in sync with the Vedas, you become Sanatani.\n~ By following casteism or rituals, you become Sanatani.\n~ Believing in mythology makes you Sanatani.\n~ By being born in a Sanatani house, one becomes Sanatani.\n\nNo! None of the above is sufficient in itself to call you a Sanatani.\nSanatan Dharma is Vedic, and the essence of Vedas is in Vedanta. The Shruti-Pramana which is necessary for any thing related to Dharma to be valid and acceptable, that Shruti Pramana is also practically Vedanta-Pramana.\n\nReligion cannot run without a scripture, if religion is without a scripture, then only people's own arbitrariness will run in it. And it is no religion that runs arbitrarily.\n\nThe Abrahamic sects have their own central texts. In Indian Dharmas also, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs also have their strong and unquestionable central texts. It is from the scripture that religion gets strength, stability and support. Can we imagine Buddhists without Dhammapada and Sikhs without Guru Granth Sahib?\nToday, Sanatan Dharma is divided into thousand parts. Its followers are often confused and directionless. Enemies of Dharma are leaving no stone unturned to disobey and disrespect Dharma by taking advantage of the weakness of Sanatan Dharma. Dharma has started to mean to blindly follow a custom, belief, or festival.\nSuperficially, there are more than a billion Sanatanis, but if you look inside carefully, it is clear that the life of Dharma is disappearing very fast. People are just Sanatani in name now. If this situation goes on for coming ten to twenty years, then even the imagination of the fate of Dharma is frightening.\n\nWe declare without any clamor: The only way to save Dharma is to place the highest scripture at the center of Dharma. Those highest texts are the Upanishads, and to be a Sanatani must mean to be a Vedanti. Those who do not read or understand Vedanta, they should ask themselves which Dharma are they following.\nThe Puranas, the Epics, and the Smritis etc. should also be read in the light of the Upanishads, and if some parts of the Smritis etc. are against the Upanishads, we should immediately discard them.\n\nToday, we will celebrate 1st October as 'Vedanta Day'. Further every year on 1st October will be celebrated as 'Vedanta Day'. It was a strange mistake anyway that a day of the year was fixed for the celebration of every little thing but no day for the remembrance and celebration of the highest body of wisdom Vedanta!\nWe propose that on this day one should meditate on the famous Shanti-Paath of the Upanishads:\n\nॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदम् पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते। पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते॥ ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः॥\n\nContemplate carefully on its meaning and also memorize the verse. Pledge that in the next one year you will study at least four Upanishads with their original meaning.\n\nTo make your work easy, we have started a campaign named 'Ghar-Ghar Upanishad' (Upanishads in Every Household) from today. Our pledge is to make the Upanishads available free of cost to 20 Crore homes.\nIt is not a matter of paitence to witness the constant decay and humiliation of Dharma before our eyes. The highest place that the Sanatana Dharma deserves must be vacated for it. If Dharma disappears from the society and country in front of us, then how will we forgive ourselves?\n\nThis campaign might have been started by an individual or an organization, but in reality this campaign is a campaign to save humanity. The truth is that wherever in the whole world, whatever is sublime and life-giving, it has Vedanta at its root in some form. The reinstatement of Vedanta will be the restoration of life.\nSupport us.","pr":"font-family: Inter;\nfont-size: 18px;\ncolor: #1E293B;\nvertical-align: top;\nfont-weight: 400;\n"},{"ii":47,"tp":"Text","x":16,"y":678,"w":249,"h":24,"n":"What is Sanatan Dhar","tx":"What is Sanatan Dharma?","pr":"font-family: Inter;\nfont-size: 20px;\ncolor: #0F172A;\nvertical-align: top;\nfont-weight: 600;\n"}],"n":"Group"},{"ii":48,"tp":"Text","x":46,"y":68,"w":222,"h":33,"n":"घर-घर उपनिषद अभियान","tx":"घर-घर उपनिषद अभियान","pr":"font-family: Kohinoor Devanagari;\nfont-size: 24px;\ncolor: #2D3748;\nvertical-align: top;\nfont-weight: 600;\n"},{"ii":49,"tp":"ShapePath","x":16,"y":79,"w":14,"h":12,"n":"ic_arrow_back","pr":"background-color: #EA580C;\n"}],"n":"Campaign Home(Ghar Ghar Upanishad Abhiyan)"}]
